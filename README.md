# urlsafe-base64
This is created by Fred Palmer (fred.palmer_at_gmail.com).
I found this on Stackoverflow and have been using it extensively, figured it was time to get this over to github and use it in bower.

## Usage

```javascript
Base64.decode('your_base64_encoded_string');

Base64.encode('your_content');
```
